# QuantumExamScheduling
This repository presents a novel approach to optimizing large-scale exam scheduling using Quantum Annealing (QA) and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). It effectively manages scheduling conflicts and resource allocation through practical real-world cases, advancing QA algorithms in education.
