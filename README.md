# QuantumExamScheduling

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for optimizing large-scale exam scheduling, particularly for complex scenarios such as makeup and retake exams. The approach utilizes Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, addressing intricate scheduling challenges. Key features include:

- **Conflict Management:** Efficiently handles conflicts related to exam room availability and timing across multiple courses and students by incorporating constraints into the Hamiltonian.
- **Resource Optimization:** Optimizes the distribution of students across exam sessions to enhance resource utilization.
- **Practical Implementation:** Demonstrates effectiveness through real-world exam scheduling cases.

This project not only presents a novel method for complex exam scheduling but also contributes to advancing the application of QA algorithms in the education sector.
